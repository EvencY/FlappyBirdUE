### This project isn't finished yet ###

### Flappy Bird ###
A simple game inspired by the once-popular mobile game.
Developed using Unreal Engine 5.4.


### About ###
This project represents my first venture into game development using C++. While I'm still studying Jerzy GrÄ™bosz's C++ books, I'm applying the knowledge I've gained so far to create a fully functional, complex game rather than just a prototype. Flappy Bird serves as the perfect canvas for implementing core programming concepts while delivering a complete gaming experience.

- Minimalistic voxel visuals created in MagicaVoxel software
- Flappy Bird's style gameplay
